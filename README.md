# Final-Project-files
 Hello!
 
 This is my Code Louisville Final Project. It is a C# engine and Windows forms based GUI game that follows an adventurer (you, the player) as they fight monsters, and complete quests. This game is pretty basic and serves simply as a proof of concept. The three project requirements that I have implemented are:
 
 1. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
 2. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
 3. Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file


 
 
 Instructions pre-game:
 Download github repository > select "Earthrim project" folder > double click "Earthrim project.sln"
 
 Instructions in-game:
 You start at home! from here you can move into the town square. There are two locations to the west (linearly), two locations to the north (linearly), and three locations to the east (linearly).
